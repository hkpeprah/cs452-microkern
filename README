Running the Program
===================
To run the application, you need to load it into the RedBoot terminal.  First, the application must be uploaded to the FTP server.  To do this, run `make upload` from the source directory (/../../), which will upload a copy of the assignment to your directory on the FTP server at `/u/cs452/tftp/ARM/YOUR_USERNAME/assn1.elf`.  To then run the application, move to the Redboot terminal and enter:

    load -b 0x00218000 -h 10.15.167.4 "ARM/YOUR_USERNAME/assn1.elf

The execution of the user tasks begins and output is rendered to the screen.  Finally, a login prompt is displayed.  Alternatively, you can copy the generated elf files from the path at: /../../


Terminal Prompt
===============
After the initial user tasks have been run in the setup process, you may log in.  After logging in, you will be presented with a prompt allowing you to enter commands.  The current supported commands are:
