/*
 * utasks.c - User tasks for first part of kernel
 * First User Task
 *    The first user task should create four instances of a test task.
 *        - Two should be at a priority lower than the priority of the first user
 *          task.
 *        - Two should be at a priority higher than the priority of the first user
 *          task.
 *        - The lower priority tasks should be created before the higher priority
 *          tasks.
 *        - On return of each Create, busy-wait IO should be used to print
 *          'Created: <taskid>.' on the RedBoot screen.
 *        - After creating all tasks the first user task should call Exit, immediately
 *          after printing 'First: exiting'.
 * The Other Tasks
 *    The tasks created by the first user task share the same code.
 *        - They first print a line with their task id and their parentâ€™s task id.
 *        - They call Pass.
 *        - They print the same line a second time.
 *        - Finally they call Exit.
